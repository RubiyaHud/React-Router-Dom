# React Router DOM
The term React Router DOM can be broken down as follows:

- **React:** Refers to the React library.
- **Router:** Refers to the routing system that enables navigation between views or pages.
- **DOM:** Stands for Document Object Model, and in this context, it indicates that this router is designed for web browsers (as opposed to `react-router-native`, which is for mobile apps).

So, in essence: 

**React Router DOM = React + Routing System for the Web DOM**

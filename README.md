# React Router DOM
The term React Router DOM can be broken down as follows:

- **React:** Refers to the React library.
- **Router:** Refers to the routing system that enables navigation between views or pages.
- **DOM:** Stands for Document Object Model, and in this context, it indicates that this router is designed for web browsers (as opposed to `react-router-native`, which is for mobile apps).

So, in essence: 

**React Router DOM = React + Routing System for the Web DOM**

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
